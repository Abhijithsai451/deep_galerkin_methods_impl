# TODO : List of Items for implementation

# Algorithm
1. Generate the sample points X_n of Domain and Z_n of Boundary
2. At Random points T_n we compute the square error G(Θ_n;T_n)
3. Apply the Stochastic Gradient Descent step at T_n by
            Θ_n+1 = Θ_n - N_n * ∆_Θ * G(Θ_n, T_n)
4. Repeat step 3 until G(Θ_n;t_n) meets the convergence condition.

# Model Development
1. Implement the model
2. Implement the Partial Differential Equation: Heat Equation
        du/dt - alpha[Thermal Diffusibility] * Laplacial[∆^2] *(u)
3. Implement the losses
        Total Loss = pde residual loss + pde boundary loss
4.
